# Task & Pay Tracker (Universal)

A lightweight, floating userscript designed for raters to monitor tasks, time, and earnings in real-time. This tool simplifies workflow management with automated timers and currency conversion.

## Features

* **Custom Task Setup:** Define your own task types with specific timers and pay rates.
* **Dual Currency Display:** Track your earnings in **USD** and automatically convert them to your **Local Currency** by setting your own exchange rate in the settings.
* **Automatic Counting:** The script beeps and adds to your total count once a task's estimated time is reached.
* **Smart Auto-Restart:** Designed for high-speed workflows. When enabled, the script detects when you click a **Submit** button on the page and automatically reloads the timer and alarm for the **last task recorded**. This eliminates the need to manually click "Start" after every submission.
* **Data Portability:** Export or Import your task definitions and settings as a JSON file to move between browsers or keep backups.
* **Flexible Interface:** A resizable, draggable, and collapsible window that stays out of the way of your workspace.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Userscript Manager:** I have tested this script with the **Violentmonkey** extension on Firefox, but it should be compatible with any major manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.
2.  **Activation:** The tracker icon appears in the **bottom right** corner when you are on the rating page.
3.  **Note:** The script usually requires a **page refresh** after installation or when first loading the rating interface to appear.
